** Nuances of the JSON to Dart Model extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hirantha.json-to-dart

1. If the top most property name equals what the class name is it won't convert.
    a. Example is teams.json - if you wrap the entire .json into a property 
       called "fantasy_touranment it won't map for some reason.  It seems to not 
       like when that property matches the class name.

2. Don't use the Yes/No flag for "enable support for adavnced" quality check.  
   a. This marks all fields "final" which prevents modification after class is instantiated.

3. The plurality of the objects is not ideal for my personal preference.  
   a. If there is a JSON array of "team_members" it creates an model called "TeamMembers" 
      and also names the variable the same.
   b. I would prefer the way https://app.quicktype.io/ does it where it would name the single object 
      "TeamMember" and then the List<TeamMember> is named teamMembers.
